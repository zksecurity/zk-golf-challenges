# R1CS counting + single-row certification

Two small utilities for measuring the RSA circuit family:

* `circuitCount` — given a circuit, count witness **allocations** and **constraint**
  rows (one row per `assert`). It *assumes* every `assert` is a single R1CS row; it
  does not re-check that. The traversal is a worklist loop over the operation forest,
  so it runs on arbitrarily large circuits without tripping the `#eval`
  deep-recursion guard.

* `isR1CSRow` / `operationsIsR1CS` — the certification that the count's assumption
  holds, stated as a *positive* `Prop` (no violation lists). `isR1CSRow e` says an
  asserted expression is a single R1CS row: it has the shape `A*B - C` with `A, B, C`
  affine (one rank-1 product, `⟨A,z⟩·⟨B,z⟩ = ⟨C,z⟩`). `operationsIsR1CS ops` says
  every `assert` in `ops` is such a row and there are no lookups/interactions, with
  subcircuits certified by their flattened bodies. `isR1CS c` is the circuit-level
  statement `operationsIsR1CS (c.operations 0)`.

`isR1CSRow` is a *sound over-approximation*: it counts products syntactically
(modulo constant scalars), so `rank ≤ r1csProducts` always. It can over-reject — e.g.
`a*b + a*c = a*(b+c)` is genuinely rank 1 but is counted as `2` — but never
under-counts, so a true multi-row `assert` is never certified as a single row.

/-! ## Single-row R1CS certification -/

/-- Structural multiplicative degree of an expression: an upper bound on its
polynomial degree (exact unless a product cancels, which only makes the check
conservative). `var` is degree 1, `const` degree 0, `add` takes the max, `mul`
adds. -/
def degree : Expression F → ℕ
  | .var _ => 1
  | .const _ => 0
  | .add a b => max (degree a) (degree b)
  | .mul a b => degree a + degree b

/-- Number of genuine degree-2 product terms along the top-level `add` spine, or
`none` if some summand is not a valid R1CS term. The `add` spine sums the counts,
so `a*b + c*d` reports `2`.

For a `mul` node we first look through any **constant** factor: a degree-0 factor
only *scales* the other side, adding no product and not raising the degree, so its
count is the count of the other factor. This is what lets a *negated* product such
as `(-1) * (A*B)` — which is how `a - b*c` desugars (`Sub`/`Neg` build
`add _ (mul (const (-1)) _)`) — still count as the single product it genuinely is.
With both factors non-constant, the node is one quadratic product exactly when both
are affine (degree ≤ 1); a factor of degree ≥ 2 means total degree ≥ 3, which is
not an R1CS row (`none`). -/
def r1csProducts : Expression F → Option ℕ
  | .const _ => some 0
  | .var _ => some 0
  | .add a b =>
    match r1csProducts a, r1csProducts b with
    | some m, some n => some (m + n)
    | _, _ => none
  | .mul a b =>
    if degree a = 0 then r1csProducts b
    else if degree b = 0 then r1csProducts a
    else if degree a ≤ 1 ∧ degree b ≤ 1 then some 1
    else none

/-- An expression is a single R1CS constraint iff, along its `add` spine, every
summand is affine plus at most one product of two affine forms — exactly the shape
`A * B - C` (one rank-1 row `⟨A,z⟩·⟨B,z⟩ = ⟨C,z⟩`). Pure-affine `A` is allowed (it
is `A · 1 = 0`). Rejected: degree ≥ 3, and two-or-more products such as `a*b + c*d`
(rank-2, which needs an auxiliary witness + a second row). -/

/-- Positive R1CS certificate over a (nested) operation list: every shallow
`assert` is a single R1CS row, there are no lookups or interactions, and each
subcircuit is certified by `flatOperationsIsR1CS` on its flattened body. By
`operationsIsR1CS_iff_toFlat` this is exactly `flatOperationsIsR1CS` on the
fully flattened operations. -/

/-- A circuit *family* (the `main` of a formal circuit) is single-row R1CS when,
allocating its inputs as *variables* at offset 0, and then instantiating the
circuit after the input allocation.

Allocating the inputs as variables — rather than checking `main default`, whose
constant inputs have degree 0 — is what makes a constraint that mentions an input
count as the rank-1 product it really is. The chosen offset is immaterial:
`isR1CSRow` inspects only the *degree* of subexpressions (`var` = 1, `const` = 0),
never variable indices, so any input/operation offset yields the same `Prop`. -/

/-! ## Compositional cost and R1CS certificates

`CostIs c K` / `IsR1CSCirc c` package the *offset-independent* facts that the
circuit `c` has operation count `K`, resp. that every assert in `c` is a single
R1CS row, at every offset. Both are preserved by the monad and loop combinators
and grounded at the leaves (`witnessVector`, `assertZero`, subcircuit/assertion
invocations), so a circuit's cost / R1CS certificate can be assembled by
structural recursion that mirrors the circuit's own shape — no `native_decide`
(which would pull the Lean compiler into the trusted base) and no unfolding of
the whole operation forest. -/

/-! ## Affine expressions and per-assert R1CS certificates

`Affine e` means `e` has structural degree ≤ 1 (no genuine degree-2 product).
The atoms of arithmetic circuits — witness variables, constants, and
field-scaled combinations of them — are affine, and affineness propagates through
`+`, `-`, constant scaling, and bounded folds. An assert built as `C - A*B`,
`C + A*B`, or `A*B` from affine `A, B, C` is then a single R1CS row — exactly the
`isR1CSRow e` hypothesis that `IsR1CSCirc.assertZero` consumes. These are the
reusable leaves used to discharge the per-assert obligations of any gadget. -/
